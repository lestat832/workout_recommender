# Start Session Protocol

You are beginning a new work session. Follow these steps in order:

## 1. Warm Greeting
Provide a friendly, energetic welcome message

## 2. Load Session
Execute the `/sc:load` command to restore previous session context

**Safety Check**: If `/sc:load` fails with "Serena MCP not available", verify that `@MCP_Serena.md` is uncommented in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (should be around line 46)

## 2b. Smart Reference Loading
**Purpose**: Load only the references needed for today's work

After session loads, help the user identify which references to load:

### Reference Loading Guide
Ask the user what they're working on, then suggest relevant references:

**Reference Map**:
```
Working on...                    ‚Üí Load these references:
------------------------------------------------------------------
ViewModels, Compose UI, Room     ‚Üí android-patterns.md
Workout generation, cooldown     ‚Üí workout-domain.md
Strava OAuth, sync queue         ‚Üí strava-integration.md
Gym setup, equipment filtering   ‚Üí gym-equipment.md
CSV import, Strong app data      ‚Üí data-import.md
UI components, wolf theming      ‚Üí ui-components.md
```

**Loading Instructions**:
1. User tells you their focus area
2. You identify relevant reference(s)
3. Inform user: "I'll load the [name] reference for you"
4. Internally note which reference patterns to use (no actual file loading needed - just awareness)

**Example interaction**:
```
User: "I want to work on the workout generation algorithm"
You: "Perfect! I'll keep the workout-domain.md reference in mind - it has the
     GenerateWorkoutUseCase implementation, 7-day cooldown logic, and equipment
     filtering priority rules. What specifically do you want to improve?"

User: "I need to build a new onboarding screen"
You: "Great! I'll reference ui-components.md and android-patterns.md for this.
     These cover Compose patterns, wolf theming, and the FTUE onboarding flow.
     What should this onboarding screen do?"
```

**Multiple References**: If work spans multiple areas, acknowledge all relevant references:
```
User: "Add Strava sync status to the workout cards"
You: "I'll reference both strava-integration.md (for sync status indicators)
     and ui-components.md (for WorkoutCard component patterns). Let's start..."
```

**Pro tip**: The core CLAUDE.md is always loaded. References are loaded on-demand only when needed for specific implementation work.

## 3. Session Briefing
After loading completes, provide:
- Quick recap of where we left off (from memories if available)
- Current status/progress
- What's next on the agenda
- Ask what the user wants to work on

**Example hello format:**
```
üëã Welcome back!

üîç Loading your previous session...

[after load completes]

üìç Where we left off:
- [brief context]

‚úÖ Completed: [X/Y tasks]
‚è≥ In Progress: [current phase]

üéØ Ready to continue with:
- [next logical task]

What would you like to work on today?
```

Keep it energetic, clear, and action-oriented!

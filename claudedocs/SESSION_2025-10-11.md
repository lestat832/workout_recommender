# Session Summary - October 11, 2025

## Session Focus
Project setup and workflow optimization

---

## ‚úÖ Accomplishments

### 1. Session Lifecycle Commands
- ‚úÖ Verified `/hello` and `/bye` commands exist globally
- ‚úÖ Copied both commands to project `.claude/commands/` directory
- ‚úÖ Updated `/bye` command to include git commit + push workflow
- ‚úÖ Applied changes to both global and project-local versions

### 2. Documentation Reorganization
- ‚úÖ Removed week-based timeline from `STRAVA_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
- ‚úÖ Reorganized roadmap into task-based sections with status indicators
- ‚úÖ Updated session summary to remove week references
- ‚úÖ Cleaner focus on "what to do" vs "when to do it"

### 3. Project Context Loading
- ‚úÖ Successfully loaded project context with `/sc:load` equivalent
- ‚úÖ Reviewed project architecture and current status
- ‚úÖ Confirmed Strava OAuth implementation is complete
- ‚úÖ Identified next phase: Data Mapping & Formatting

## üìù Key Decisions

### `/bye` Command Workflow
**Final Order:**
1. Optimize Context (update docs, mark todos)
2. **Commit and Push Changes** (if changes exist)
3. Save Session (`/sc:save`)
4. Friendly Goodbye

**Rationale:**
- Commit after context optimization ensures all documentation is included
- Commit before session save captures clean git state
- Push to GitHub ensures work is backed up remotely
- Always automatic if changes exist (no prompt needed)

### Roadmap Format
- Switched from week-based timelines to task completion tracking
- Status indicators: ‚úÖ (complete), ‚è≥ (in progress), ‚è∫Ô∏è (pending)
- More flexible for user's development pace

---

## üìÇ Files Modified

### Slash Commands
- `~/.claude/commands/bye.md` - Added commit + push step
- `.claude/commands/bye.md` - Project-local copy updated
- `.claude/commands/hello.md` - Copied to project (no changes)

### Documentation
- `STRAVA_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Removed week references, task-based organization
- `claudedocs/STRAVA_SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated to remove week references

## üéØ Current Project Status

### Strava Integration Progress
**Phase 1: MVP (Core Sync Functionality)**

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Pre-Implementation Setup
- Database & API Client
- OAuth Flow (end-to-end working)

‚è≥ **Current:**
- Data Mapping & Formatting

‚è∫Ô∏è **Next:**
- Sync Worker & Queue
- Settings Integration & Notifications

### Technical Context

## üöÄ Next Session Tasks

### Data Mapping & Formatting
1. Create `domain/mapper/` directory
2. Build `WorkoutToStravaMapper.kt`
   - Map Workout ‚Üí StravaActivityRequest
   - Handle PUSH/PULL ‚Üí "Weight Training"
   - Format date to ISO-8601
3. Build `StravaDescriptionFormatter.kt`
   - Implement Format A (detailed with emojis)
   - Group exercises by muscle
   - Calculate total volume and duration
4. Test formatting with sample workouts

**Reference:** See `STRAVA_SYNC_REQUIREMENTS.md` for Format A details

## üí° Notes for Future

- `/hello` command now properly loads context at session start
- `/bye` command handles full workflow: optimize ‚Üí commit ‚Üí save ‚Üí goodbye
- All documentation now task-focused rather than time-based
- Session summaries stored in `claudedocs/` for continuity

---

**Session Type:** Setup & Organization
**Duration:** Configuration and planning session
**Next Focus:** Strava data mapping implementation

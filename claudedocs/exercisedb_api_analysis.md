## 4. Mapping Rules: ExerciseDB â†’ Target Schema

### 4.1 Muscle Group Mapping

```kotlin
fun mapMuscleGroups(primaryMuscles: List<String>, secondaryMuscles: List<String>): List<MuscleGroup> {
    val allMuscles = (primaryMuscles + secondaryMuscles).distinct()
    val muscleGroups = mutableSetOf<MuscleGroup>()

    allMuscles.forEach { muscle ->
        when (muscle.lowercase()) {
            "chest" -> muscleGroups.add(MuscleGroup.CHEST)
            "shoulders" -> muscleGroups.add(MuscleGroup.SHOULDER)
            "triceps" -> muscleGroups.add(MuscleGroup.TRICEP)
            "biceps" -> muscleGroups.add(MuscleGroup.BICEP)
            "lats", "middle back", "lower back", "traps" -> muscleGroups.add(MuscleGroup.BACK)
            "quadriceps", "hamstrings", "glutes", "calves", "adductors", "abductors" ->
                muscleGroups.add(MuscleGroup.LEGS)
            "abdominals" -> muscleGroups.add(MuscleGroup.CORE)
            // forearms, neck are ignored (minor muscles)
        }
    }

    return muscleGroups.toList()
}
```

### 4.2 Equipment Mapping

```kotlin
fun mapEquipment(equipment: String?): String {
    return when (equipment?.lowercase()) {
        null -> "Bodyweight"
        "body only" -> "Bodyweight"
        "barbell" -> "Barbell"
        "dumbbell" -> "Dumbbell"
        "cable" -> "Cable"
        "machine" -> "Machine"
        "kettlebells" -> "Kettlebell"
        "bands" -> "Resistance Band"
        "exercise ball" -> "Exercise Ball"
        "e-z curl bar" -> "EZ Bar"
        "foam roll" -> "Foam Roller"
        "medicine ball" -> "Medicine Ball"
        "other" -> "Other"
        else -> equipment.capitalize()
    }
}
```

### 4.3 Image URL Mapping

```kotlin
fun mapImageUrl(images: List<String>?): String? {
    val baseUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/main/exercises/"
    return images?.firstOrNull()?.let { baseUrl + it }
}
```

## 5. PUSH vs PULL Classification Rules

### 5.1 Analysis of Force Distribution

Based on analysis of 873 exercises:

**PUSH Muscle Groups (367 exercises):**
- Quadriceps: 100 exercises
- Shoulders: 80 exercises
- Chest: 72 exercises
- Triceps: 68 exercises
- Hamstrings: 14 exercises
- Calves: 14 exercises
- Glutes: 13 exercises

**PULL Muscle Groups (387 exercises):**
- Abdominals: 84 exercises
- Biceps: 49 exercises
- Hamstrings: 47 exercises
- Middle Back: 30 exercises
- Lats: 30 exercises
- Lower Back: 16 exercises
- Traps: 15 exercises
- Forearms: 20 exercises

**STATIC (119 exercises):**
- Stretching and isometric holds

### 5.2 Classification Logic

The ExerciseDB API provides a `force` field that can be used directly:

```kotlin
fun mapWorkoutType(
    force: String?,
    primaryMuscles: List<String>,
    category: String?
): WorkoutType {
    // First: Use force field if available
    when (force?.lowercase()) {
        "push" -> return WorkoutType.PUSH
        "pull" -> return WorkoutType.PULL
        "static" -> return WorkoutType.PULL // Treat static as PULL (or create STATIC category)
    }

    // Fallback: Classify by primary muscles
    val muscleClassification = primaryMuscles.firstOrNull()?.lowercase()

    return when (muscleClassification) {
        // PUSH muscles
        "chest", "triceps", "shoulders", "quadriceps", "calves", "glutes" ->
            WorkoutType.PUSH

        // PULL muscles
        "biceps", "lats", "middle back", "lower back", "traps",
        "hamstrings", "abdominals", "forearms" ->
            WorkoutType.PULL

        // Default to PULL for unknown
        else -> WorkoutType.PULL
    }
}
```

### 5.3 Refined Classification Rules

**PUSH Exercises Include:**
- Chest presses, flyes, push-ups
- Shoulder presses, raises
- Tricep extensions, dips
- Squats, lunges, leg presses (quad-dominant)
- Calf raises

**PULL Exercises Include:**
- Rows, pull-ups, lat pulldowns
- Bicep curls
- Deadlifts, hamstring curls (hamstring-dominant)
- Core exercises (planks, crunches)
- Traps exercises (shrugs)

**Edge Cases:**
- **Shoulders:** Can be both PUSH (presses) and PULL (reverse flyes, face pulls). Use `force` field to determine.
- **Hamstrings:** Usually PULL (deadlifts, curls) but can be PUSH (leg curls). Check `force` field.
- **Core/Abdominals:** Generally classified as PULL in the dataset.

## 7. Data Access Methods

### Option 1: Free Exercise DB (Recommended for Development)

**Endpoint:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/main/dist/exercises.json`

**Advantages:**
- No API key required
- Free and open-source
- 873 exercises
- Public domain license
- Includes images

**Limitations:**
- No pagination (single large JSON file ~2.5MB)
- No search/filter endpoints
- Static dataset (infrequent updates)

### Option 2: ExerciseDB RapidAPI (Production)

**Endpoint:** `https://exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com/`

**Advantages:**
- RESTful API with filtering
- 1300+ exercises
- Regular updates
- Pagination support

## 8. Implementation Recommendations

### 8.1 Data Loading Strategy

```kotlin
// Download and cache the entire dataset on first app launch
class ExerciseRepository {
    suspend fun syncExercises() {
        val url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/main/dist/exercises.json"
        val response = httpClient.get(url)
        val exercises = response.body<List<ExerciseDbJson>>()

        // Transform and save to local database
        exercises.forEach { exerciseJson ->
            val exercise = Exercise(
                id = exerciseJson.id,
                name = exerciseJson.name,
                muscleGroups = mapMuscleGroups(exerciseJson.primaryMuscles, exerciseJson.secondaryMuscles),
                equipment = mapEquipment(exerciseJson.equipment),
                category = mapWorkoutType(exerciseJson.force, exerciseJson.primaryMuscles, exerciseJson.category),
                imageUrl = mapImageUrl(exerciseJson.images),
                instructions = exerciseJson.instructions
            )
            database.exerciseDao().insert(exercise)
        }
    }
}
```

### 8.2 Schema Adapter

```kotlin
data class ExerciseDbJson(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val force: String?,
    val level: String,
    val mechanic: String?,
    val equipment: String?,
    val primaryMuscles: List<String>,
    val secondaryMuscles: List<String>,
    val instructions: List<String>,
    val category: String,
    val images: List<String>
)

fun ExerciseDbJson.toDomain(): Exercise {
    return Exercise(
        id = this.id,
        name = this.name,
        muscleGroups = mapMuscleGroups(this.primaryMuscles, this.secondaryMuscles),
        equipment = mapEquipment(this.equipment),
        category = mapWorkoutType(this.force, this.primaryMuscles, this.category),
        imageUrl = mapImageUrl(this.images),
        instructions = this.instructions
    )
}
```

### 8.3 Filtering by Muscle Groups

```kotlin
fun filterByMuscleGroup(exercises: List<Exercise>, targetGroup: MuscleGroup): List<Exercise> {
    return exercises.filter { it.muscleGroups.contains(targetGroup) }
}

fun filterByWorkoutType(exercises: List<Exercise>, type: WorkoutType): List<Exercise> {
    return exercises.filter { it.category == type }
}

fun filterByEquipment(exercises: List<Exercise>, equipment: String): List<Exercise> {
    return exercises.filter { it.equipment == equipment }
}
```

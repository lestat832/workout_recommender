# IMPORTANT: Image Setup Instructions

## Current Status
The app now has vector drawable placeholders for the wolf images to fix the build errors. These are simplified geometric representations that allow the app to compile and run.

## To Use Your DALL-E Images

### Option 1: Use Android Studio (Recommended)
1. Download the three images you showed me from DALL-E
2. In Android Studio, right-click on `app/src/main/res/drawable`
3. Select "New" > "Image Asset"
4. Choose "Action Bar and Tab Icons"
5. Select your wolf head logo image
6. Name it `ic_wolf_logo` (this will replace the vector version)
7. Repeat for the other images

### Option 2: Manual Replacement
1. Save your images as:
   - `ic_wolf_logo.png`
   - `wolf_howling_splash.png`
   
2. Create these folders if they don't exist:
   ```
   app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/
   app/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/
   app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/
   app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/
   app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/
   ```

3. Place appropriately sized versions in each folder
4. Delete the XML versions from `drawable/`

### Option 3: Use a Single Resolution
For quick testing, you can:
1. Create folder: `app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/`
2. Place your PNG images there
3. Delete the XML versions

## Why This Approach?
- I cannot directly write binary PNG files to your project
- The vector drawables are functional placeholders
- Your actual DALL-E images will look much better
- This allows the app to build and run immediately

## App Icon
For the launcher icon, use Android Studio's Image Asset tool:
- Right-click `res` → New → Image Asset
- Select "Launcher Icons (Adaptive and Legacy)"
- Use your wolf logo with the charcoal background
